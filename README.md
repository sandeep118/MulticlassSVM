# MulticlassSVM
This project consists of 4 parts :
1. First part is implemetation of binary SVM for two class recognition. Code for this is found in Step0.m.
2. Now the other three parts are implementation of Multiclass SVM using different methods as below:
   Method                  Corresponding file   
   One Vs All extension :  Step1.m 
   One Vs One xtension  :  Step2.m
   Error correct coding :  Step3.m
3.Each of the above files will perform following functions:
  a. Load the corresponding dataset and invokes SVM.m which implements the Binary SVM classifier.   
  b. Predict the classifier obtained on testing dataset and displays the accuracy on it.
  c. Above two steps are performed for different cost functions.
