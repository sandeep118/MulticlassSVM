# MulticlassSVM
This project consists of 4 parts :<br />
1. First part is implemetation of binary SVM for two class recognition. Code for this is found in Step0.m.:<br />
2. Now the other three parts are implementation of Multiclass SVM using One vs All extension(Step1.m),
   One vs One extension(Step2.m),error correcting coding(Step3.m)<br />
3. Each of the above files will perform following functions:<br />
   * Load the corresponding dataset and invokes SVM.m which implements the Binary SVM classifier.
   * Predict the classifier obtained on testing dataset and displays the accuracy on it.
   * Above two steps are performed for different cost functions.
